# Random Walk

### What is it?
- A random-walk is a stochastic process that models the random steps taken by a 'walker' in each time-step. While this seems like pointless wandering-about, it has a wide range of applications in the real world.
- Many theoretical models are built using the random-walk process such as Brownian-motion, Fermi-estimation, etc. The real-world sees its own share of this implementation in the form of gambling models, size of the internet and so on.[1]
